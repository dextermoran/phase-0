         Hi Internet! There’s this cool thing called git that is a method of version control that 
         lets you keep track of different versions of your work. No more Project_finial_revision_2_final.jpg anymore!
         Git creates an archive file of your work at it’s various stages. This means that if you ever want to revert to a
         previous version of your file you can pull up a log of your commits, review the messages you left as you changed things,
         and revert to any of your save points by using the number associated with it. Additionally, git allows you to create branches
         of your projects to work on. This is super cool because it lets you work on new features while keeping the master branch of 
         your project stable and unchanged until your new feature is ready to be merged in. 
      </p>

      <p>
         The real icing on the cake though is that git can be paired with a web service called GitHub that keeps your repository 
         in the cloud. This lets you not only keep your work backed up, but lets you share your code with others and work collaboratively
          on a project. This is super important to remember because all the best things get build with others.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

    We used the html, head, title, meta, body, header, h1, article, h2, p, figure, and footer tags. 
    These tags, and several other semantic tags not used in this exercise are fundamental parts of html. 
    Their use over div tags is good practice and makes code far more readable.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

    The browser displays things in the order they are listed in the html file. 
  
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? 
What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

    We Learned how to create and save code snippets. I think these have the potential to save an enormous amount of time and are defiently something i will incorporate into my workflow.
