- Log into your GitHub account and click the plus icon at the top right and fill out the form. Now, at the top of the repository content, there is a url for you to copy. Open a terminal on your machine and navigate to the location you'd like to copy the repository to. type "git clone " and paste the link. 
- Open source is the practice of sharing source code, rather than just the compiled code, and allowing others to change or modify it however they'd like.
- I don't think that open source is necessarily utopia but it is certainly a good thing. I think that open source can result in better more flexible products for users that can be developed in an environment that does more to foster learning and intellectual pursuit over profit. 
- Using licenses is important because the specify the sharing permissions of a project and ensure that the original author still receives credit for their work. Furthermore, some can prevent a project from being distributed unethically or being made closed source at a later date. 
- This challenge allowed me to practice what i had learned in the previous few challenges in a more unguided manner. Everything went pretty smoothly which is exciting!
