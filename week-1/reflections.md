# Reflections 

## Thinking about time

  In about an hour of research on productivity and time management techniques i learned about a few new ideas and a a bit more about a few i was already familiar with. These concepts varied from exercises such as flow, meditation, and mindfulness, which to me feel fairly abstract and personal, to methods such as the Fogg method or the Pomodoro technique, which seem far more formulaic.

  In the past, I've been introduced to the Pomodoro method of time management. This is a method of time boxing wherein one works until a given amount of time has elapsed and then evaluates the amount of progress made, rather than the reverse. However, for me the twenty five minute segments of the Pomodoro method frequently feel too short to accomplish enough work to feel meaningful and the interruption of the timer disrupts my focus. As a result of this I generally modify the time chunk to fit the kind of task and go by a clock, instead of a timer, as it is less obtrusive and allows me to find more natural stopping points. This method has worked really well for me over the last two years and is something i plan on sticking with through phase zero. 




## The Command Line

A few weeks prior to the start of phase 0 I went through Codecademy’s command line tutorial in preparation and as a result I felt pretty comfortable with most of this exercise. The least intuitive part of the command line for me is probably the cp command which i tend to remember as standing for copy/paste, even though they do not function in the same way.

I feel that the pipe command and the man command are probably the two most valuable as pipe allows for advanced manipulation of data or files through the combination of multiple commands, while man allows one to easily reference a guide on a specific command.

-pwd - Print working directory displays the current location of the user in the file system.

-ls - Lists the contents of the current directory.

-mv - Moves a file from one directory to another.

-cd - Changes the current directory of the user.

-../ - Moves the user one directory up in the file tree.

-touch - Creates a new, empty file.

-mkdir - Creates a new directory.

-less - displays the contents of a file in a paginated manner.

-rmdir - Removes a directory. Will only work on empty directories unless the -r tag is used for a recursive delete.  

-rm - Removes files.

-help - Provides a list of available commands.

A shell is an interface for interacting with an operating system via natural language commands.


Bash is the language used by the unix command line shell.


## Forking and Cloning

Forking a repository allows for the duplication of existing work. This would be preferable to creating a new repository if one wanted to build on what had already been done or take a project in a new direction.

 

In order to fork a repository one would:

 

Visit the GitHub page of the original author of the desired repository.
Click the fork link in the upper right hand corner and select one’s own account.
Viewing the repository on one’s own account copy the link provided.
Open a terminal and navigate to the desired location for the repository.
Type “git clone “ and then paste the link previously copied from GitHub.
The repository should now be in the specified directory.

Setting up git with GitHub and practicing pushing files really reinforces the usefulness of such a service. The process of using both the web interface and the command line does seem a little odd to me though. While it very well may be the most efficient method, it would feel more natural to use one or the other exclusively.
