PSEUDOCODE 

***Task 1***

  Define a method named sum 
  Input: an Array of Integers
  Output: The sum of every number in the array. 
  

  4. Return total. 
  
  
***Task 2*** 
  
  Define a function called mean
  Input: An Array of Integers
  Output: The mean (average) of the numbers in the array 
  
  1. Define a variable called total and set it equal to zero
  2. Iterate through the Array that was recieved as an argument. 
  3. At each index of the array add the value of the current index to total
  4. Define a new variable called mean and set it equal to total divided by the length of the array. 
  
  
***Task 3*** 

  Define a function called median 
  Input: an Array of unsorted Integers
  Output: The median number of the array
  
  1. Sort the array passed as an argument so the numbers are ordered smallest to largest (look in the Array docs, there is an easy way to do this.)
  2. Declare a variable called listMiddle and set it equal to the length of the array divided by two
  3. Check if the the length of the array is evenly divisible by two 
  4. If it is (the length of the array is even) then return the value at the index of listMiddle and listMiddle + 1
  5. If it is not (the length of the array is odd) then return the value at the index listMiddle
