## What does puts do?
#### puts stands for put string. It essentially just prints whatever follows it to the command line with a new line following it. 
## What is an integer? What is a float?
#### An interger is a whole number while a float is a number with a decimal point. 
## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
#### float division is just normal division like we learned in math class. Interger division however returns only an interger and does not report the remainder.
