## What does puts do?
#### puts stands for put string. It essentially just prints whatever follows it to the command line with a new line following it. 
## What is an integer? What is a float?
#### An interger is a whole number while a float is a number with a decimal point. 
## What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
#### float division is just normal division like we learned in math class. Interger division however returns only an interger and does not report the remainder.

```
print "hours in a year:"
puts 365 * 24

print "minutes in a decade:"
puts 10 * 365 * 24 * 60

```

## How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
#### Exactly has one would expect it too with the exception of division where ruby distinguishes between interger and floar division.
## What is the difference between integers and floats?
#### An interger is a whole number where as a float is a floating point number - meaning it has a devimal point. 
## What is the difference between integer and float division?
#### Interger division returns a whole number and leaves out the remainder. Float division will return a number with a decimal, as if it were done on a calculator.
## What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
#### Strings are the variable type used for letters. they can contain just about any character. 
## What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
#### A variable with scope limited to the function it is declared within.
## How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
#### I think it was helpfull. The month of not using ruby since applying was more than enough time for me to be in need of a review.
